My name is Matthew Peveler. I am currently working as a senior software engineer at
[TigerData](https://tigerdata.com) (formly Timescale), after it acquired [PopSQL](https://popsql.com),
where I was a full-stack engineer. Before that, I was working on my PhD in Computer Science at
[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu), where I worked in the
[Cognitive and Immersive Systems Lab](https://cisl.rpi.edu) under my advisors,
[Dr. Selmer Bringsjord](http://homepages.rpi.edu/~brings/) and [Dr. Hui Su](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huisu/).
My research was in the application of reasoning and planning in the usage of large-scale cognitive
systems. Outside of work, I am a principal maintainer on a number of open-source projects,
such as [Submitty](https://submitty.org), [phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx),
and [asciidoc-py](https://github.com/asciidoc-py/asciidoc-py). See my CV and GitHub for the full
list of my research and work.

Outside of work and programming, I am an avid skier, consumer of various forms of media, and
[lover of beer](https://untappd.com/user/Master_Odin). Since 2022, I have also gotten into
brewing my own beer as well, though I'm still very much an amateur at it. I have had the great
fortune of working as a Ski Patroller at Sugarbush, VT for the ski seasons between 2016 - 2022, and
then volunteering for the 2015-2016 season, and then 2022 - 2024 seasons. In 2024, I joined the
volunteer ski patrol at Brighton in Utah. I have also previously held my EMT-B certification for NYS
where I rode with [RPI Ambulance](https://rpiambulance.com) as well as worked for a private ambulance
company in the Capital District in NY.
