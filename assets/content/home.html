<h2>hello</h2>
My name is Matthew Peveler. I have a BS in Computer Science from the College of New Jersey and I'm pursuing a PhD at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 

<br /><br />
I work under <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/~brings">Dr. Selmer Bringsjord</a> as part of the <a href="http://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu" target="_blank">Rensselaer AI and Reasoning Lab</a>.
My research interests are in the use of human-level reasoning within AI systems.
